**AWLF-Fast** is a high-performance, JIT-compiled implementation of the Adaptive Weighted Local Fitting algorithm, designed specifically for **Uncooled Thermal Imaging (Long-wave IR)**.

Unlike the [Reference Implementation](你的MIT仓库链接), this engine is optimized for **Production Environments**.
## 🧩 Algorithm Pipeline

![AWLF-Fast Pipeline](Untitled diagram-2026-01-20-105901.png)

**Key Innovations:**
*   **Numba JIT Compilation**: Critical loops are compiled to native machine code, achieving 60+ FPS on 1024x1024 images.
*   **Adaptive Weighting**: Blending between polynomial fitting (texture) and median (noise) based on local gradient.
*   **16-bit Native Support**: Direct processing of industrial thermal sensor outputs without precision loss.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Achieves **60+ FPS** on standard CPU (i7-10th gen) for 640x512 video streams.
*   **🏭 Industrial Ready**: Native support for **16-bit RAW / TIFF** data (no dynamic range loss).
*   **🧵 Parallelized**: Fully utilizes multi-core CPUs via SIMD vectorization and OpenMP.
*   **🛡️ Robust**: Handles dead pixels (blind pixels) and stripe noise common in IR sensors.
## 👁️ Visual Results & Performance

We evaluate AWLF-Fast on standard infrared benchmarks under varying impulse noise densities (20%, 40%, 60%).

### 1. Global Comparison (Robustness Test)
> **Observation**: The algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness across all noise levels. Even at **60% noise density**, where traditional median filters fail (causing "salt-and-pepper" artifacts), AWLF-Fast successfully reconstructs the global structure.

### 2. Zoom-in Details (Texture Preservation)
> **Key Feature**: Unlike standard filters that blur edges, AWLF-Fast preserves sharp transitions (e.g., hat brim, facial features) using adaptive local fitting.

#### Case A: Low Density (20%)
*Ideal for routine sensor calibration.*

#### Case B: Medium Density (40%)
*Simulating degraded sensor conditions.*
![Zoom 40%](roi_detail_40pct.png)

#### Case C: Extreme Density (60%)
*Stress test for industrial failure scenarios. Note the clean reconstruction of the eye region.*
